"Zoning shapes the city; through zoning, a city controls building size, population density, and the
way land is used.  Along with the city's power to budget, tax, and condemn property, it is a key
                                                3
tool for carrying out planning policy            ". The current NYC zoning resolution was enacted and took
effect in 1961.  This zoning resolution coordinated use and bulk regulations, and incorporated
parking requirements.
The City is divided into three separate zoning districts: Residential (R), Commercial (C), and
Manufacturing (M).  These three basic categories are further subdivided into low, moderate, and
high density districts.
Development        within   these districts is regulated by use, bulk, and parking regulations.  Each
zoning district regulates permitted uses, the land/building size ratio, the required open space,
required setbacks, and the amount of required parking.
The uses permitted in each district are found within one or more of the eighteen Use Groups.
The uses listed in each group have common functional or nuisance characteristics, the higher the
use group, the greater the nuisance.
                        SA                                  MPL                                               E
Bulk  (building size) is regulated by the use of Floor Area Ratios (FAR) and Open Space Ratios
(OSR).  These control the physical volume of buildings, as well as the relationship of building size
to land area.  The FAR expresses the relationship of the amount of useable floor area to the
amount of lot area.  Therefore a 10,000 square foot lot with a FAR of 10 could contain 100,000
square feet of floor area.  This maximum floor area is further reduced by applying an Open
Space Ratio.  The OSR, found in residential districts, requires that a minimum amount of open
lot area be provided for each square foot of floor area. Expressed as a percent, an OSR of 20
would mandate that 20,000 square feet of open land area be provided for a 100,000 square foot
building.
Other standards reducing building size include maximum density requirements (units per acre),
front,  side    and    rear   yard    requirements,       maximum        building     height    regulations,  and    parking
requirements.
Manufacturing uses and certain intense commercial uses are subject to performance standards
which limit noise, air pollution, and other nuisance creating activity.
Regulations are not binding on properties constructed prior to the 1961 resolution.  Properties
that have been grand-fathered are considered legal, pre-existing, non-conforming uses.  They
may not be altered other than to conform to zoning.
Many of the properties in the City do not conform to zoning, mainly due to the lack of off-street
parking.  Variances and special permits may be granted on a property by property basis.
